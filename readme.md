# GitHub Actions Security Scanner

GitHub is a central hub for software developers to collaborate on projects. While tools like GitHub Actions (GHA) automate testing and deployment, they also introduce potential security risks. Malicious exploitation of GitHub Actions can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, and execution of harmful scripts within repositories.

## Introduction

GitHub Actions (introduced in 2019) is a powerful Continuous Integration (CI) tool that automates tasks within the software development lifecycle. It consists of:

- **Workflows** â€“ Automated processes defined in `.yml` files.
- **Events** â€“ Triggers that start workflows.
- **Jobs** â€“ Units of work within a workflow.
- **Steps** â€“ Individual tasks inside a job.
- **Actions** â€“ Reusable components within workflows.
- **Runners** â€“ Environments executing workflows.

However, this automation can be exploited by attackers inserting unauthorized commands, running arbitrary scripts, or creating seemingly legitimate actions that trigger harmful activities.

## Security Risks in GitHub Actions

- **Unauthorized access** â€“ Attackers may gain control over repositories.
- **Data manipulation** â€“ Malicious workflows can modify sensitive data.
- **Code injection** â€“ Arbitrary scripts can be executed within workflows.
- **Supply chain attacks** â€“ Compromised dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities.

## Project Goal

Our project aims to enhance the security of GitHub Actions by developing a **robust scanning tool** that detects malicious behavior in workflow files. Instead of manually checking `.yml` files, users can leverage our tool to **identify suspicious patterns and assess security risks efficiently**.

## How It Works

Our tool operates in three critical phases:

### 1. Understanding YAML Files

- Parses GitHub Action YAML files to analyze workflow configurations.
- Extracts key elements such as jobs, steps, and executed commands.

### 2. Malicious Command Database

- Maintains a repository of known harmful commands and attack patterns.
- Continuously updates to include emerging security threats.

### 3. Rule-Based Engine

- Scans GitHub Action YAML files systematically.
- Rates files on a **1 to 5** scale based on potential maliciousness.
- Flags suspicious activities for further review.

## Benefits

âœ… **Enhanced Security** â€“ Prevents unauthorized modifications in workflows.  
âœ… **Automated Scanning** â€“ Reduces manual effort in reviewing YAML files.  
âœ… **Risk Assessment** â€“ Provides clear security ratings for workflows.  
âœ… **Continuous Protection** â€“ Regular updates against evolving threats.

## Conclusion

By integrating our GitHub Actions Security Scanner, developers can **safeguard their CI/CD workflows** against malicious threats. This project contributes to a more secure GitHub ecosystem, enabling safe and efficient software delivery while leveraging the power of automation.
